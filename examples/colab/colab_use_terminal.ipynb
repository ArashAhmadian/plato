Mount Your Google Drive\n","\n","Since Google Colab removes all the files that you may have downloaded or created when you terminal a session, the best option is to use GitHub to store your code, and Google Drive to store your downloaded datasets and anything else needed by your Plato training sessions that you would normally store on your local filesystem.\n","\n","You can use the code below to mount your Google Drive, which may contain your downloaded datasets. When you run the code below, you will need to click a link and follow a process that takes a few seconds. When the process is complete, all of your drive files will be available via ‘/content/drive/’ on your Colab instance."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"z5gW8LQivFHs"},"outputs":[],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"exlQPjof-lZ4"},"source":["## 2.
