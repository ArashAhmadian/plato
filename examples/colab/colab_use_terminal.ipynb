When the process is complete, all of your drive files will be available via ‘/root/drive’ on your Colab instance, and this will allow you to structure your projects in the same way you would if you were using a cloud server."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"z5gW8LQivFHs"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","root_path = '/content/drive/My\\ Drive'\n","%cd $root_path"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5xlN-jMfoEpp"},"source":["\n","\n","Clone Plato's public git repository on GitHub to your Google drive.
